2) We need more recent data, or data collected at regular intervals.  It seems hit or miss as to when agencies release their data, and how.  A static pdf may check the ""we did it"" box but it's not particularly useful.
3) Wherever the decision originated to use regional planning group geographies instead of county geographies, it is *not* appreciated.  Year over year comparisons of county data are now impossible. ????????????????????  
In my personal opinion, CT is backwards and wasteful for not using county government and county geographies for planning and admin purposes.  We should immediately go back to using counties as the default geography for Census and other data, and add RPG geographies as an optional view, just as Congressional Districts are.
Thank you.","External users and government agencies would benefit from standardized, frequently updated data sets from both state and quasi agencies.  It's not rocket science to say that we could be making more efficient, impactful decisions if we did a better job of connecting, and using, the data we have.

At the CT 359 Network, we have documented 20 years of data challenges among existing state data systems related to young children and their families in CT.  Most important is the state's inability to link unique child data (and information) with data about their families -- in real time  and across agencies.  This failure prevents effect care management and coordination at the individual level, improved accountability for spending and outcomes at the state level, and effective strategic planning at the state level. ","Developing plans or grant documents;Advocacy ;Link it with other data (e.g. administrative data);Policy planning, advocacy and accountability;",Daily,Somewhat concerned,Somewhat concerned,Very likely,Very likely,Very likely,Very likely,Very likely,Very likely,Agree,Strongly Agree,Neither agree or disagree,Strongly Agree,Strongly Agree,Agree,Strongly Agree,Agree,Neither agree or disagree,Strongly Agree,Agree,"Concrete actions should be guided by the problems they seek to solve. 

In CT, we are missing children whose early development is at risk or delayed because we cannot employ real time data systems that link information about them and their families.  Each year, there are several thousand young children (and their families) caught in this circumstance.  These data on numbers of affected children are available from the UConn Center on Developmental Disabilities and the CT Medicaid Program. 

There are at least two concrete pathways to action that would enable improved care coordination on a child-by-child basis as well as aggregated, deidentified data for population and geographic analyses and quality improvement. Both require data to be accessible and in real time across state agencies. 

(a)	Craft legislative language requiring OPM and DAS BITS to propose a technology solution plan for unique child and family data connections in real time (on a statewide basis or pilot basis) potentially  using state- licensed commercial technology. A report back to the legislature by early fall 2025 would be required. The precedent for this pathway was set in 2023 and 2024 through the following legislation:  (PA 24-45 Sec. 21(b)  -- data integration for older disconnect youth-- and PA 23-137 Sec. 13  -- for persons with an intellectual or developmental disability.  While a viable pathway, this is probably not the best answer in that it produces reports but no action. 

(b)	Propose a two-city pilot, including New Haven as one site with another to be identified (Hartford or perhaps Norwich) to test a  commercial technology “network solution” to find, match and identify practice, policy and fiscal issues in real time connectivity. This pathway is offered in lieu of a similar proposal to just solve the problem once and on a statewide basis. 


","Because children and families live in communities and not in state agencies, local communities have been trying to solve these problems literally for two decades.  We have identified at least 10 service improvement efforts that are disconnected from knowledge sharing -- and data development progress.  You could pull these efforts forward so we can learn how each is addressing the problem(s) identified above. ",,

I've lived and worked in a few states over the past 25 years and this struck me as apparent immediately upon moving here with my family almost 3 years ago. One way the state can help is to pick a few of those responsibilities up. Data collection, standardization and public accessibility is one of the obvious functions. The state already does at least a little of this via statewide land and parcel data, but the potential is bigger. ",,,

I've entered my info below on this form for a follow up conversation, but to quickly put a few things out:
- Access appears to be very good.
- Interoperability is the big one.  What I see is that a common ID between systems is a very big challenge requiring a data owner.  Without the interoperability piece working well, it will force users to have to download each data set and then try to connect them when doing any analytics work.
-- Common Applications between multiple state departments, connected internal systems (lot of data alignment work needed here), reviewing currently collected information with the goal of minimizing the amount of entries users must make, feeding information in real-time to centralized databases (ODS, Data Lake, etc) for more reporting flexibility, policy alignment between departments and policy reduction where possible (Is this how it's always been?  If so, can we update this to reduce overhead?), linking back into the state any augmented data
- No concerns on security.
- Quality of data looked good, but a lot of the reports looked older and I couldn't find a way to download historical data sets to see trends over time.
