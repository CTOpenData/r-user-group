## Project Description
This repository includes files for the R User Group for CT state agencies.
As the project grows, related scripts, outputs and slide decks will be grouped into
subject folders.

## Getting Started
Since this repository doesn't house a single product, but rather 
a collection of Connecticut-specific use-cases,
Users are encouraged to peruse the topics/folders that are most applicable 
to their interests or their work for the state.  

## Contents Overview
Despite the different topic areas in the repository we will
strive to keep folder conventions the same where it makes 
sense to do so.  Scripts will be at the root of a topic folder
and relevant data and outputs will go in their respective subfolders `data` and `output`.
Some topics may benefit from additional subfolders like the `geos` folder which
will contain a subfolder `shapefiles` that will help users with limited API/internet access.

### learning_r
The `learning_r` folder is a great place for users new to R and R Studio to go 
and familiarize themselves with the language and its most popular IDE.

For installation help users' first stop should be `learning_r/output/install_intro_v3.html`.
### geos
The `geos` folder contains scripts, data, outputs and shapefiles all related
to the typical work surrounding Geographic Information Systems (GIS) including 
but not limited to mapping, address cleaning and accessing various state 
and federal APIs.

### slide_decks

The `slide_decks` folder houses the slide decks of presentations that group
members have presented.
