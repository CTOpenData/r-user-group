## Project Description
This repository includes files for the R User Group for CT state agencies.
As the project grows, related scripts, outputs and slide decks will be grouped into
subject folders.

## Getting Started
Since this repository doesn't house a single product, but rather 
a collection of Connecticut-specific use-cases,
Users are encouraged to peruse the topics/folders that are most applicable 
to their interests or their work for the state.  

### geos
The `geos` folder contains scripts, data, outputs and shapefiles all related
to the typical work surrounding Geographic Information Systems (GIS) including 
but not limited to mapping, address cleaning and accessing various state 
and federal APIs.
