## Quarto

Quarto enables you to weave together content and executable code into a finished document. To learn more about Quarto see <https://quarto.org>.  If you are familiar with RMarkdown documents in
earlier versions of R and RStudio you can think of Quarto as the "next generation" tool.

Most "modern" versions of RStudio come with a basic functioning version of Quarto installed.
But to get all the lastest features and functionality I recommend you install the 
"Quarto Command Line Interface" see the hyperlink in the sidebar.



## Running Code

When you click the **Render** button a document will be generated that includes both content and the output of embedded code. You can embed code like this:

```{r}
1 + 1
```

You can add options to executable code like this 

```{r}
#| echo: false
2 * 2
```

The `echo: false` option disables the printing of code (only output is displayed).
