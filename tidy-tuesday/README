# R User Group #TidyTuesday Challenge
Join the R User Group in a #TidyTuesday Challenge, where we will make data visualizations using R and share them in our July 15 meeting!
 
## What is #TidyTuesday?
- We’re doing a #TidyTuesday Challenge for the R User Group, where we’re making data visualizations and sharing for our July meeting.
- The wider R community participates in #TidyTuesday on a weekly basis. Every Tuesday, a new dataset is posted on GitHub for anyone to explore, analyze, and visualize using tidyverse tools. Check out #TidyTuesday on social media to see other R users’ work.

## How can I participate?
- Participants in the R User Group are invited to create a data visualization for the #TidyTuesday R User Group Challenge using the EV Registration Data (https://data.ct.gov/Transportation/Electric-Vehicle-Registration-Data/y7ky-5wcz).
- Explore, analyze, and visualize the EV registration data using R. Make any type of data visualization or other data science-related output to share. Whether this is your first-ever R data viz or your thousandth, we hope this is a fun way to dig into some real data!
- You can share your viz in this folder or email it to us by Tuesday, July 8.
- We'll have a show and tell to share our vizzes at the July 15 R User Group meeting!

## Why Join?
- Practice using R, data viz, & storytelling
- Use real CT open data
- Build your skills with the R community
- Low-pressure & fun!
